                            <p>As a member of the American Association of Christian Counselors I personally have a Christian Worldview in my approach to life.  As a therapist I do not impose my beliefs on my clients.  However, for those clients who want to integrate prayer and spirituality to some aspects of therapy I am flexible and will work with you.  Foundational theological issues should be managed by your Pastor and/or Clergy in the church where you attend.  I am respectful of denominational and theological beliefs.</p>
